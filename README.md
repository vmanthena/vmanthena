# 👋 Hi, I'm Nitin V. Manthena

### 🚀 Principal Software Architect | Scalable & Secure Systems @ 300K+ TPS | Cloud-Native • Full-Stack • DevSecOps • Observability-First

---

I architect and deliver **high-performance, secure, and resilient platforms** across the cloud and enterprise stack — from core system APIs to cloud-native services with zero-downtime rollouts.

As a Principal Software Architect, I bring **15+ years** of experience and a proven ability to own every phase of the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** — from whiteboard design and stakeholder alignment to development, deployment, observability, and post-production optimization.

🔹 My systems power **millions of users**, sustain **300K+ TPS**, and are built with clarity, traceability, and long-term maintainability in mind.  
🔹 I thrive in **cross-functional teams**, mentor engineers without micromanaging, and believe that **well-architected systems are readable, testable, observable, and secure by default**.  
🔹 I lead **cloud modernization**, strengthen security architecture, and scale platforms without ever compromising performance — or budgets.
